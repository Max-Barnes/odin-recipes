    <p>Description: This is my signature steak recipe. It is quite simple but very flavorful</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>sirloin steak</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>garlic powder</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First coat the pan in butter, pam or olive oil and set to medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the steak with a generous amount of salt pepper and garlic powder</li>
        <li>Add the steak to the pan once it is hot</li>
        <li>Place the fresh rosemary ontop of the steak</li>
        <li>Give the steak roughly 5 minutes on each side</li>
        <li>When you flip the steak add more butter ontop of it to soak the steak while it is still cooking</li>
        <li>Use a spoon and safely scoop the steak juice from the pan back on the steak</li>
        <li>Once steak is medium-rare (as it should be) take it off the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Add leftover juice in the pan to the steak while it is resting</li>
        <li>Once rested, Enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
